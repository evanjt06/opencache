I made this as a basic exercise to make my own (KV) cache system like Redis. Opencache is an in-memory key-value (KV) store / cache that implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm to free up space when the cache's preset capacity is overflowed. I also added a Time to live (TTL) feature for key expiration for cache records.

all operations for read, update, and delete are O(1) b/c of the double-ended queue and cache ops. validation for the cache keys have also been added so that only comparable elements can be keys. Opencache is also thread-safe because I used mutex, so it is multi-client safe. Added basic persistence with AOF log files.
